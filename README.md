each of these parameters will be a URL to an image that you wish to load asynchronously and apply as a background-image dynamically.

      "https://hello.com/hello.jpg",
      "https://hello.com/hi.jpg",
      "https://hello.com/bonjour.jpg",
      "https://hello.com/labasrytas.jpg",
      "https://hello.com/hallo.jpg"
    ]);
    
each image will be applied asynchronously as a background-image to the elements you specify.
